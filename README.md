# Conway's Game of Life

This is a no player game invented by John Horton Conway in 1970. Once the board's
initial state is determined, the game can start its "evolution." 

**Game rules**

Each grey cell represents a living cell, and white cell represents a dead cell 
or no life cell. Every cell's living status in the next round will be determined
by its neighbours:

1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

*from wikipedia*

**How to play**

Before pressing the start button, user can change the living status
of a cell by clicking on that cell. After setting up the initial board,
user can click on the start button to begin its "evolution." User can also
pause, resume, or restart the game at any time.
